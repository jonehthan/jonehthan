# About Me

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Political Science with a passion for exploring the intersectionality between tech and politics.

Through my coursework and internships, I have developed my skills in coding, data analysis, and software development in Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and React.

My interest in political science has also equipped me with a nuanced understanding of policy frameworks, governance structures, and socio-political dynamics. I am particularly interested in how technology intersects with governance, policy-making, and public discourse, and I actively engage in research projects exploring these intersections.

Given the prominence of AI technologies, I am deeply invested in the future of ethical AI and responsible technology. I believe in harnessing the power of AI and emerging technologies to drive positive social change while mitigating potential risks and biases. Through my coursework, extracurricular activities, and research initiatives, I aim to contribute to the development of ethical frameworks and policies that ensure technology serves the collective good.
